## Features

- User Registration (Signup): Allow users to create new accounts by providing required information such as username, email, and password.

- User Authentication (Login): Enable users to securely authenticate themselves by providing their credentials (username/email and password).

- Password Encryption: Implement strong cryptographic hashing algorithms to securely store user passwords and protect them from unauthorized access.

- Email authentication that allows users to send emails through their servers. It offers different features like adding HTML in the mail.

- Token-based Authentication: Implement token-based authentication mechanisms (e.g., JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication and secure API access.
